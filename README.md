# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  LIRI will display your latest tweets. As we do not want to display your personal account, or its keys, please make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!
